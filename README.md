Use NASA data to find the best spots to install your photovoltaic panels! <br>

This project was submited to the [You Are My Sunshine Challenge](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/you-are-my-sunshine/details) from NASA's Space Apps Challenge 2021 Hackathon.

In this MVP version, the only power line data available is from PoÃ§os de Caldas, Brazil. Try it out!

## Description

Find my Sun shows the user a heatmap of the best place to install photovoltaic panels, considering the ambient temperature, solar irradiation and the proximity to the distribution lines of energy. Beyond that, the app calculates, from parameters inserted by the user (as area available and current consumption of energy) the price of the project (photovoltaic power plant plus the distribution line, if need it) and how much time it will take for the user to get a payback. Just a disclousure: the distribution lines and price features are not yet available.

Initially, the app's homepage display a simple map so the users can find their location and select the area to verify the viability to install the photovoltaic panels. The heatmap has 9 shades of orange that shows the possibility of building a photovoltaic power plant. The lighter the shade of color is, less indicated is to build. Also, the user can filter the energy company data, if the distance of the power plant to the distribution line is not relevant. The potential energy that will be generated is calculated using the sun irradiation on the surface of the Earth (one of the datas provided by NASA that we used). The second data provided by NASA that we used was ambient temperature to calculate the photovoltaic panel's temperature and determinate its efficiency.

By using Find my Sun, the user has a free and easy way to find the correct place to install his photovoltaic panels. So, by giving more information about it the renewable sources will be easier to reach, making the world cleaner and healthier.

We asked to professionals in the energy field their opinions about our project and we got positive feedback and some advices. So, we hope to achieve their expectations, besides that, we want to reach everyone across the globe, from amateurs to professionals, and eventually, becomes a reference and an example in the renewable sources of energy area.

We coded our app using JavaScript with the React Native framework. Also, we inserted data provided by energy companies that indicate distribution lines of energy. The equations to calculate the photovoltaic panel temperature and it's efficiency we found it from two scholarly articles.
